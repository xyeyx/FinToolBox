# FinToolBox

I don't (yet) have working experience in the Finance and Risk Management sector. So to mitigate this disadvantage, I try to accumulate working experience by playing around myself. All codes in this folder will be written in Python.

I try to be as accurate as possible but cannot provide any guarantee for the correctness on my codes. They are not peer-reviewed. So if you need to play with real world transactions: Use at your own risk.
